# A VBA script to analyze stock data in Excel
#### Loops through an Excel spreadsheet of stock data and outputs:
 - The yearly change in price for each stock, as well as the percentage
    *  Also will apply conditional formatting to denote positive or negative change
 - The total stock volume
#### Also will output the stock with:
  - The greatest % increase
  - The greatest % decrease
  - The greatest total volume
#### Worksheet will need to have seven columns (the data in the date, high, and low columns does not matter as it is not used and columns can be named anything):
| Ticker Symbol| Date   | Open  | High | Low   | Close  | Volume |  
| ------------- |:------:| -----:| ----:|------ |:------:| ------:|
